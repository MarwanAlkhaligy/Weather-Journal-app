# Weather Journal App Project
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Openweather Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Overview

1- I made some modifying to HTML and CSS files to make the layout more simple as I can.

2- I wrote comments to make the code more readable.

3- I have used extention on the URL (&units=metric) to get the Celsius Temperature.

## Instructions on how to use :-
 1- Write the ZIP code of the city (United States)
 2- You can write your feelings if you want [optional].
 3- The application will show you temperature, date, your feelings.
